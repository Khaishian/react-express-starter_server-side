link for heroku deployed app: https://react-express-starter-client.herokuapp.com/

A simple tutorial from bradtraversy, he made a simple app tut for react as frontend and express as backend all in one folder. I have separated it into server side folder and client side folder. Then I deployed separately to heroku after added setupProxy.js and updated the react-scripts.
